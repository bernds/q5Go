C[Captures
Welcome to this beginner-level tutorial on captures in Go.
]
;W[fg]
C[Captures
As a reminder about the rules, once a stone or a connected group of stones loses its last liberty, it is removed from the board.
Captured stones are worth one point each.
]
;AW[eb][fc][gb]AB[fb][ff]AE[fg]
C[Captures
Sometimes, stones are already called "captured" when there is no way to save them.]
;LB[fb:A][ff:B]
C[Captures
Sometimes, stones are already called "captured" when there is no way to save them.
The black stone marked A cannot evade capture, while B could be saved.
]
;AB[fa][fg]
C[Captures
Let's play out the continuation on each side.
Black must extend to avoid being captured. This gives additional liberties to the groups.
]
;AW[ga][gg]
C[Captures
Let's play out the continuation on each side.
White continues to attack.
]
;AB[ea][eg]
C[Captures
Let's play out the continuation on each side.
And Black tries to escape.
]
;AW[da][dg]AE[ea][fa][fb]
C[Captures
At the edge of the board, liberties are more scarce.
In the center, Black's stones still have two liberties, and counterattacks are now possible.
]
;AW[cc][dd][dh][ed][fd][gd][hd][he][hf][hg][ig][ih][ii][ij][ik][kg]AB[dc][ec][fc][gc][hc][id][ie][if][jg][jh][ji][jj][jk]AE[da][dg][eb][ef][eg][fe][ff][fg][ga][gb][gf][gg]
C[Captures
While this is tutorial is about captures, it is important to know that sometimes, capturing is unnecessary.
Unnecessary moves are bad.
]
;B[kf]
C[Captures
Black could attack the white stone.]
;W[cb]
C[Captures
In response, White will just take a big move which enlarges the left-side territory.
]
;B[kh]
C[Captures
With the last two moves, Black has managed to capture the white stone, but this was unnecessary: it could not have escaped anyway.
]
;AW[kg]AE[cb][kf][kh]
C[Captures
You might like to try playing with this position to convince yourself that White cannot save that stone.
]
;W[jf]
C[Captures
Here is just one possible example. Once White tries something unreasonable, it is OK for Black to spend moves to actually remove stones from the board.
]
;B[je]
C[Captures
Now we have the familiar shape of a capture on the second line. Neither of White's stones can be saved.
]
;W[kf]
C[Captures
Just a few more moves to clearly show the result.]
;B[ke]
C[Captures
Just a few more moves to clearly show the result.]
;W[kh]
C[Captures
Just a few more moves to clearly show the result.]
;B[ki]
C[Captures
Just a few more moves to clearly show the result.]
;AW[ff][ge]AB[ef][fe][gf][gg]AE[cc][dc][dd][dh][ec][ed][fc][fd][gc][gd][hc][hd][hf][hg][id][ie][if][ig][ih][ii][ij][ik][je][jg][jh][ji][jj][jk][ke][ki]TR[ff]
C[Captures
Let's recap something we've seen before: the ladder.
White's stone cannot escape.
]
;AW[ci][cj][dh][di][eg][eh][fg]AB[bi][bj][ch][dg][dj][ei][fh]
C[Captures
If White tries to escape, the group is driven towards the edge of the board and runs out of liberties.
]
;AE[bi][bj][ch][ci][cj][dg][dh][di][dj][ef][eg][eh][ei][fg][fh]TR[ef]
C[Captures
Going back, it is important to ask: should Black play at the marked point to capture the stone in a ladder?
]
;W[]TR[ff]
C[Captures
Here, the white stone is a cutting stone which separates two black groups. Capturing it is important.
]
;AE[ge][he]
C[Captures
If we remove the white stones on the other side, the white stone becomes unimportant.
]
;B[]LB[ef:B][ge:A]
C[Captures
Black now has equally good alternatives (miai) to connect at A or capture at B.
(To be completely accurate, the capture at B is not quite as good, since White might play a ladder breaker.)
]
;W[ge]
C[Captures
What if White cuts? Should Black now play the ladder?
Maybe.
]
;B[fd]
C[Captures
It is also possible to consider a move such as this.
]
;W[]LB[ef:B][he:A]
C[Captures
Once again, there are equivalent options: Black has ladders available in two directions to capture one stone and thereby connect his groups.
]
;AW[fd][he]AB[ee]TR[ff]
C[Captures
Let's look at a slightly different position. Black has an additional stone, and the question is: what is the best way to capture the marked white stone?
]
;B[ef]
C[Captures
Of course the ladder works, as before.
]
;W[dh]TR[ff]
C[Captures
But White has the opportunity to play a ladder breaker, and Black now may need to spend another move to remove White's stone from the board.]
;AE[dh][ef]
C[Captures
In the original position, there is a more solid way of capturing the white stone.
]
;B[eg]
C[Captures
Black creates a net. Sometimes the term geta is used as well.
]
;W[ef]
C[Captures
White's stone cannot escape.
]
;B[df]
C[Captures
White's stone cannot escape.
]
;W[fg]
C[Captures
White's stone cannot escape.
]
;B[fh]
C[Captures
White's stone cannot escape.
This is the result if White tries to save it.
]
;AW[ff]AE[df][fh]
C[Captures
There are no ladder breakers available to White with this shape.
However, there are other moves White can try.
]
;W[df]
C[Captures
A peep threatens to connect to the captured stone.
]
;B[ef]
C[Captures
A peep threatens to connect to the captured stone.
]
;W[fh]
C[Captures
A peep threatens to connect to the captured stone.
]
;B[fg]
C[Captures
In the end, White has been able to play two stones on the outside which may be useful in the future.
However, these peeps are usually not quite as devastating as ladder breakers.
]
;AW[ed][ff]AE[df][ef][eg][fg][fh]
C[Captures
Liberties are always important.
]
;B[eg]
C[Captures
Liberties are always important.
In this situation, the net does not work.
]
;W[ef]TR[ee][fe]
C[Captures
White pushes out, and the marked stones are in atari.
]
;B[de]
C[Captures
Black has to extend to avoid capture
]
;W[df]
C[Captures
But White has escaped the net, and more fighting will follow.]
;AW[hf][hg]AE[de][df][ef][eg]
C[Captures
If we give White even more stones on the outside to take away Black's liberties, the situation is worse.
]
;B[ef]
C[Captures
Even the ladder does not work anymore.
]
;W[fg]
C[Captures
Black cannot continue the ladder, since two stones are in atari.
]
;AE[ef][fg]TR[ee][fe][gf][gg]
C[Captures
Black has no way to capture the single white stone.
Always keep track of the number of liberties and develop a sense of danger for when they run low.]
;AW[ef]AB[de]AE[ed][hf][hg]
C[Captures
Let's show a more successful example again. This is another pattern where the net works.
]
;B[dg]
C[Captures
With this move, White's two stones cannot escape.
]
;W[df]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to demonstrate.]
;B[cf]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to demonstrate.]
;W[eg]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to demonstrate.]
;B[eh]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to demonstrate.]
;W[fg]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to demonstrate.]
;B[fh]
C[Captures
All other attempts also fail.
]
;AW[ch][ei][fb][gb][gd][hc][ic][jc][jd]AB[ec][fc][gc][hd][id][if][je]AE[cf][de][dg][ee][eh][fd][fe][fh][ge][gf][gg][he]TR[gd]
C[Captures
Let's see more capturing techniques.
Here, the goal is for Black to capture the marked white stone.
]
;B[ge]TR[ch]
C[Captures
The ladder does not work. The marked white stone acts as a ladder breaker.
]
;AW[cf][de][df][ed][ee][fd]AB[ce][dd][dg][ef][fe]TR[bf]
C[Captures
The ladder would run up to this point, and now the pattern would continue with a play at the triangled point for Black.
But then White connects with the ladder breaker.
]
;B[cg]
C[Captures
What if Black varies the pattern?
]
;W[bf]
C[Captures
White now has three liberties.
]
;B[bg]
C[Captures
Black tries to separate the white stones.
]
;W[dc]TR[ec][fc][gc]
C[Captures
But now White has enough liberties, and so it is Black who is captured.
]
;AE[bf][bg][ce][cf][cg][dc][dd][de][df][dg][ed][ee][ef][fd][fe][ge]
C[Captures
So, what can Black do here? There are two options.
]
;B[ge]
C[Captures
Black can still start with this move.
]
;W[fd]
C[Captures
Let's assume White believes these stones can't be captured, and extends.
]
;B[ee]
C[Captures
We saw the net pattern earlier, and this looks similar, but there is a difference.
]
;W[he]TR[hd][id]
C[Captures
Black has two stones with only two liberties, and White gives atari.
]
;B[ie]
C[Captures
These stones are important, so Black connects.
]
;W[fe]TR[ge]
C[Captures
White now threatens another stone. But Black had been planning to give it up.
]
;B[ff]
C[Captures
Rather than save the single stone, Black reduces White's liberties to one.
]
;W[gf]
C[Captures
White captures the single black stone.
]
;B[ed]
C[Captures
Now Black can give atari again - three white stones can be captured on the next move.
]
;W[ge]
C[Captures
If White tries to connect, it just enlarges the loss.
]
;B[gg]
C[Captures
Black plays the final atari, and there is no escape.
]
;W[]
C[Captures
This kind of sequence, where a player gives up a stone to force the opponent into a clump with few liberties, is called a squeeze.
]
;AE[ed][ee][fd][fe][ff][ge][gf][gg][he][ie]
C[Captures
Going back, there is another method to capture the white stone.
It is a variant of the net.
]
;B[fe]
C[Captures
Black can play here, and there is no escape for White.
]
;W[ge]
C[Captures
Once again, let's assume White tries to run out.
]
;B[gf]
C[Captures
Black blocks.
]
;W[he]
C[Captures
White turns, and this move is atari against two black stones.
]
;B[ie]
C[Captures
Black connects, and White is down to two liberties, and cannot gain any additional ones.
]
;W[hf]
C[Captures
Any further struggle is futile.]
;B[hg]
C[Captures
Any further struggle is futile.]
;W[fd]
C[Captures
Any further struggle is futile.]
;B[ed]
C[Captures
Any further struggle is futile.]
;AW[di][fj]AB[ej][fi][gj]AE[ch][ec][ed][fb][fc][fe][gb][gc][gf][hc][hd][hg][ic][id][ie][if][jc][jd][je]TR[fj]
C[Captures
In the "Basic Tactics" tutorial, we saw that a stone on the second line is vulnerable to capture.
]
;AW[dh][eh][fi]AB[ei][fh][gi]AE[di][ej][fj][gj]TR[fi]
C[Captures
What if we move the pattern up by one line? Is the white stone still captured?
]
;W[fj]
C[Captures
Let's try to save it.]
;B[ej]
C[Captures
Black blocks on the left, since a play by White here can't be allowed.
]
;W[gj]
C[Captures
White tries to run away.
]
;B[hj]
C[Captures
Taking away another liberty leaves weaknesses in Black's position.
]
;W[hi]
C[Captures
White counterattacks.]
;B[gh]
C[Captures
White counterattacks.]
;W[ij]
C[Captures
White counterattacks and wins the fight.]
;AE[gh][hi][hj][ij]
C[Captures
Let's go back a bit.
]
;B[hi]
C[Captures
Black might try to surround a little more loosely.
But this doesn't take away a liberty from White and thus also allows a counterattack.
]
;W[fg]
C[Captures
Forcing once is good technique.
]
;B[gh]
C[Captures
Black is forced to connect, and notice how the empty triangle shape has appeared.
]
;W[dj]
C[Captures
Now White plays here, which immobilizes the two black stones.
This is somewhat similar to a net, and a shape that often occurs on the side.
]
;B[hj]
C[Captures
Black can try to take away White's liberties, but White gets there first.]
;W[di]
C[Captures
Black can try to take away White's liberties, but White gets there first.]
;B[gk]
C[Captures
Black can try to take away White's liberties, but White gets there first.]
;W[ek]
C[Captures
Black can try to take away White's liberties, but White gets there first.]
;AB[ei][ej]AE[di][dj][ek][fg][gh][gk][hi][hj]TR[gh][hi]
C[Captures
In this situation, there is nothing Black can do.
However, things would be different if there were a black stone at either of the marked points (and several others).
]
;AE[ej][fj][gj]
C[Captures
So, in the original pattern, we also need at least one additional stone for Black to make the capture work.
]
;AB[gh]
C[Captures
Like this...
]
;AB[hi]AE[gh]
C[Captures
... or like this.]
;AW[fg]AB[ce][ch]AE[dh][ei][fh][fi][hi]
C[Captures
The kinds of shapes we have looked at are bulding blocks.
Let's see how the previous pattern we looked at can occur in a real sequence.
]
;B[]
C[Captures
It's not important that you memorize the following sequence. It's a corner sequence that does occur in games, but we use it just as an illustration.
]
;W[ci]
C[Captures
This move could be seen as an attempt to separate Black.
Once again, it is not important to fully understand every move in this sequence.
]
;B[di]
C[Captures
Black responds.]
;W[dh]
C[Captures
White cuts.]
;B[ei]
C[Captures
Black attempts to connect to the stone in the lower right.
]
;W[cg]
C[Captures
White gives atari. This is the third-line pattern we saw, but White does not have the extra stone needed to actually capture the black stone.
]
;B[bh]
C[Captures
So, Black extends.
]
;W[cf]LB[bi:A]
C[Captures
Now, White adds a stone that would help to capture the two black stones if White could play at A.
]
;B[bi]
C[Captures
Black saves the two stones and captures a white stone instead.
]
;W[de]
C[Captures
White bends around the lone black stone, and the sequence comes to an end.
]
;B[]TR[ce]
C[Captures
Black has a lot of profit, but White has separated one black stone from the others and reduced its liberties to two.
]
;W[]
C[Captures
Since White was outnumbered at the start, this can be a reasonable way of playing.
]
;AW[ei][ej][ek][fa][fb][fc][fd][fe][ff][gg][gh][gi][hi][hj][hk]AB[ci][cj][ck][dg][dh][ea][eb][ec][ed][ee][ef][eg][fh][fi][fj][fk]AE[bh][bi][ce][cf][cg][ch][de]TR[eh][ei][ej][ek]SQ[fh][fi][fj][fk]
C[Captures
What is going on in this position?
Sometimes it is not clear who is attacking whom. Both of the marked strings of stones are in danger of being captured.

]
;B[dj]
C[Captures
If Black goes first, White is in atari already.
]
;W[gj]
C[Captures
It's too late to do anything about it.
]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Black wins.
]
;AW[eh][ei][ej][ek]AE[dj][dk][gj]LB[gj:A][gk:B]
C[Captures
And, since the position is symmetrical, the same would be true if White were to play first at A or B.
]
;W[]TR[eh][ei][ej][ek]SQ[fh][fi][fj][fk]
C[Captures
A situation where two groups are threatening to capture each other is called a capturing race. Another term for it is semeai.
]
;AW[hg][hh]AB[gj][gk]AE[fk][gh][gi]TR[fk]
C[Captures
Let's modify the position a little. Now there is a liberty shared between the two groups involved in the semeai.

]
;B[dj]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to see if that makes a difference.
]
;W[gh]
C[Captures
Let's play it out to see if that makes a difference.
]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Now White is in atari again.
]
;W[gi]
C[Captures
White is too late.
]
;B[fk]
C[Captures
Black wins.
]
;AW[eh][ei][ej][ek]AE[dj][dk][fk][gh][gi]
C[Captures
So, as before, whoever goes first can win the semeai.
]
;B[fk]
C[Captures
But what if Black plays here first?
Now the situation is the same as in the first example, but it is White's turn.
]
;W[gh]
C[Captures
White fills a liberty and is going to win the race.
]
;AE[fk][gh]TR[fk]
C[Captures
This shows a general principle: in a capturing race, it is usually best to play from the outside first, and take shared liberties only at the end.
]
;AW[gh][ii][ij][ik]AB[gi]AE[fj][hj][hk]
C[Captures
Let's add another inside liberty and see how that affects the position.
]
;B[dj]
C[Captures
Let's have both sides fill outside liberties first, as we learned.]
;W[hj]
C[Captures
Let's have both sides fill outside liberties first, as we learned.]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Let's have both sides fill outside liberties first, as we learned.]
;W[hk]TR[fj][fk]
C[Captures
Now we have a different situation.
Neither side wants to play at the marked points, since that would be self-atari.
]
;B[]TR[fj][fk]
C[Captures
We saw this in the Life and Death tutorial, it is called a seki. Both sides live. In fact, it was unnecessary to fill the outside liberties.]
;AB[cg][ch]AE[dh][di][dj][dk][hg][hj][hk]
C[Captures
So far, the positions have been symmetrical.
If one side has a large advantage in the number of liberties, it may not be much of a race.
Here, Black is down four liberties to six.]
;B[dh]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.
]
;W[hj]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.
]
;B[di]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.

;W[hk]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.

;B[dj]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.
]
;W[fj]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.
]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Let's even have Black start, and play out the sequence from here.
]
;W[fk]
C[Captures
White wins, despite Black playing first in the capturing race.
]
;AB[fh][fi][gi][gj][gk]AE[dh][di][dj][dk][fj][fk][hj][hk]
C[Captures
Going back to the original position, Black is already captured. White does not need to add stones until Black tries to start something by filling liberties.
]
;AW[ji][jj][jk]AB[dh][di][hj][ij][ik]AE[cg][ch]TR[hk]
C[Captures
Here's another possibility. In a capturing race, one side might have an eye.
(Remember the Life and Death tutorial: a group with two eyes is alive.)
]
;W[]TR[hk]
C[Captures
Here, White has four liberties to Black's three. What happens if White goes first?
]
;W[fj]
C[Captures
White is forced to play on an inside liberty. Playing in the eye is not a valid move until it becomes a capture.
]
;B[dj]
C[Captures
After two moves, White's advantage in the number of liberties has disappeared.
]
;W[fk]
C[Captures
Continuing, White would have to play an inside liberty again, but this is self-atari.
]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Black wins.
]
;AW[eh][ei][ej][ek]AE[dj][dk]
C[Captures
In a capturing race, the side with an eye can have a large advantage if there are shared liberties.
]
;AW[ac][ad][ah][bd][bh][cd][ch][ci][da][db][dc][dd][di][dj][dk][ga][gb][gc][hc][ic][jc][kc]AB[ab][ai][ak][ba][bc][bi][bj][ca][cb][cc][ha][hb][ib][ja][jb][kb]AE[dg][dh][ea][eb][ec][ed][ee][ef][eg][eh][ei][ej][ek][fa][fb][fc][fd][fe][ff][fg][fh][fi][gg][gh][gi][gj][gk][hh][hi][hj][ii][ij][ik][ji][jj][jk]
C[Captures
Captures are inextricably linked to life and death - see the earlier tutorial.
This position shows some minimal black groups which are alive.
]
;AW[ak][ba][ja]
C[Captures
In contrast, with white stones on the vital points, these groups are unable to make two eyes and are dead as they stand.
]
;AW[bb]AB[ac]AE[ah][ai][ak][ba][bh][bi][bj][ca][ch][ci][cj][ck][da][di][dj][dk][ga][gb][gc][ha][hb][hc][ib][ic][ja][jb][jc][kb][kc]
C[Captures
Earlier, we stated that playing moves to capture stones which cannot escape is unnecessary and therefore bad. But life and death considerations give us counterexamples.
]
;B[ba]
C[Captures
Here, Black should take the white stone. Black's group now has two eyes and is alive.
]
;AW[bb]AE[ba]
C[Captures
What happens if Black leaves the position without playing another move?
]
;W[ba]
C[Captures
White extends, making a larger sacrifice.
]
;B[ca]
C[Captures
Black can capture these two white stones.
]
;W[da]
C[Captures
Let's play out a few more moves...]
;B[aa]
C[Captures
White's two stones are captured, but now we see the problem: Black has only one eye, and no way to make another.
]
;W[ba]
C[Captures
If White needed to remove the black stones, it can be done by just filling the two remaining liberties.
]
;AW[bj][ch][ci][cj][dg][dh][dk][eg][ej][fg][fj][fk][gh][gk][hh][ih][ii][ij][ik]AB[di][dj][ei][fi][gi][gj][hj][hk]AE[aa][ab][ac][ad][ba][bc][bd][ca][cb][cc][cd][da][db][dc][dd]
C[Captures
This is an important concept: sacrifices can be good to destroy the opponent's shape. Here's a more spectactular example.
]
;W[ek]
C[Captures
White makes a big clump with only one liberty. In this position, that is a good move.
]
;B[ck]
C[Captures
Black might be happy to take out six white stones.
]
;W[fk]
C[Captures
But now White plays on the vital point, and Black can make only one eye in the available space.
This is the "bulky five" shape which was shown in the life and death tutorial.]
;B[ek]
C[Captures
As an example, if Black tries to subdivide the space into two eyes...
]
;W[fj]
C[Captures
White extends. White's two stones can be captured again, but that doesn't help Black: only one eye will remain.
]
;AW[di][dj][ei][fi][gi][hi][hj]AB[ej][fj]AE[bj][ch][ci][cj][ck][dg][dh][eg][ek][fg][fk][gh][hh][hk][ih][ii][ij][ik]
C[Captures
Let's look at something else. We have a black group with three liberties. It looks a little sad and has no hope of living.
]
;AW[bi][bj][ci][ii][ji][jj]AB[cj][dj][hj][ij]
C[Captures
Things get more interesting when we enlarge the black group.
Now, considerations of life and death come into play.
]
;B[ik]
C[Captures
Let's say Black plays here.
]
;W[ck]
C[Captures
White reduces the available eye shape.
A move like this is often a killing move, so it is important to remember.
Here, it does not work.]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Black descends again, and the four-space shape should be familiar from the earlier tutorial.
Black is alive.
]
;AE[ck][dk][ik]
C[Captures
What if White goes first?
]
;W[ik]
C[Captures
This sort of bend around is called a hane (approximately pronounced "hah-ney").
Hane once...
]
;B[hk]
C[Captures
Black answers.]
;W[ck]
C[Captures
Hane twice...
]
;B[dk]
C[Captures
Black answers.
]
;W[fk]
C[Captures
Play on the vital point, and Black is dead.
]
;B[]TR[ck][ik]
C[Captures
The two marked white stones are in atari and can be captured, but that is irrelevant to the outcome. Capturing them only makes false eyes.
]
;B[jk]
C[Captures
Let's play it out for a bit.]
;W[kj]
C[Captures
Let's play it out for a bit.]
;B[bk]
C[Captures
Let's play it out for a bit.]
;W[kk]TR[jk]
C[Captures
